# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`                                            compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`                                            watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`                                             perform the jest unit tests

 * `cdk init --language`                                      initialize your new AWS CDK app

 * `npx npm-check-updates -u`                                 Updating your language dependencies
 *
 * `cdk deploy [stack] --require-approval never --profile my` deploy this stack e.g. **LambdaStack** to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`                                                 compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`                                                emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk bootstrap`                                            Run when error raised: This stack uses assets, so the toolkit stack must be deployed to the environment with command **cdk bootstrap aws://aws-account/aws-region**
 * `cdk destroy stack`                                        Delete stack(s)
